## 🚀 READY FOR TESTING - STEP BY STEP

### **📱 STEP 1: OPEN NOTION MOBILE APP**
1. Open your Notion mobile app
2. Navigate to your action items database
3. Look for the updated actions with CEO workflow guides

### **🔍 STEP 2: EXAMINE ENHANCED ACTIONS**
Each action now shows:
- **📋 CEO WORKFLOW GUIDE** - Clear status instructions
- **📊 What happens on Complete** - Detailed implementation plan

**For API Key Rotation (ACT_006_API shown in your screenshot)**:
- **Prerequisites**: ✅ You have backup API keys in .env file
- **Risk Level**: Low (testnet keys, automatic rollback)
- **Duration**: 5-10 minutes
- **What happens**: Automatic API key rotation with testing
